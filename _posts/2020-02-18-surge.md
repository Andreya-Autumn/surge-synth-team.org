Surge is an Open Source Digital Synthesizer, originally sold as a commercial product by Vember Audio, run by Claes Johanson. In 2018, Claes
decided to open source a partially completed version of the synth under GPL3, and a group of developers have been improving it since.
That group is the surge synth team!
