Dexed is an amazing free synth, reliably one of the most popular open source synthesizers. It models the Yamaha DX-7 incredibly well and
provides those great FM sounds.

We maintain a fork which runs a bit ahead of the main Dexed where we are adding a couple of core features

* Microtuning support
* MPE Support
* Automated builds and more modern build infrastructure
* Some UI improvements

We are committed to merging our fork into the master regularly, but if you would like to try our bleeding edge feature fork
you can grab a nightly build and grab our code.

* [Code for our Fork on GitHub](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/dexed.git)
* [Grab a VST3/AU/Standalone Nightly built for Mac, Windows or Linux](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/dexed/releases/tag/Nightly)
