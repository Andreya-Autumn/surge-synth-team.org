## Joining the Surge Synth Team

Wanna join the surge synth team? There’s no application process! Just show up, be
friendly, and contribute. We work hard to make a welcoming community of music
enthusiasts.

The best way to reach us is to join our [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/surgesynth/shared_invite/enQtNTE4OTg0MTU2NDY5LWZkMjllNDAzZjYzNTc4NjUzNjk2OGUxNDYzZTYyZTU3ZGU4OTY4MzhkNzcwZGE5ZDQyMzk5MjE1ODEzZTFmODI) or hit us up on [github](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer) but many of us also hang out in this [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/surgesynth/) or on [KVR](https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=511922).

And we really don’t have any rules other than don’t be a jerk! (If you want to be a
jerk online there are plenty of options). Have an idea? We would love to hear it.
Happen to be a Windows C++ plugin developer? We need your help? Think you’ve
found a bug? You probably have! Want to contribute content? Go for it!
